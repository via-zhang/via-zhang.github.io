      <description>&lt;p&gt;Living with South Florida, I have seen the impacts of hurricanes and other disasters on our communities. As a geography and data science student, much of my work and research involves geographic information systems (GIS), which allow us to visualize data on maps and analyze spatial patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I started volunteering with Team Rubicon, a national nonprofit organization that organizes international disaster response efforts to disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. On their GIS team, I provide GIS support to a range of projects, from creating interactive dashboards for use in planning disaster response to labeling floodded roads and fallen trees in high-resolution satellite imagery taken in the aftermath of a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
