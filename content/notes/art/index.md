{{< note title="Over the Years">}}

Reflecting on my background living in South Florida and my passion for geography and data, I created Over the Years, a digital artwork featuring a timelapse of flooding from sea level rise and a graph of changing sea levels over time. As part of the Climate Storytelling 2075 Anthology, this artwork was exhibited in fall 2025 at the Queens Council on the Arts in partnership with Ofrenda Fest in Queens, New York.

The artwork, titled “Coalescence” (the process of coming together to form a larger whole), includes a self portrait paired with a visualization of Apalachicola River in Florida, with data from the NOAA Office for Coastal Management. This artwork was featured in the Chengyu for Change zine with a workshop about environmental futures hosted at the Miami Beach Regional Library.
