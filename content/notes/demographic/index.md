{{< note title="Geographic Mobility Map">}}
This series of maps from 2012 to 2022 visualizes how the political party affiliation of voters who moved to Florida from other states changed over the years. I wrote a script to clean voter file data for multiple years, aggregated statistics by state with R, and created the maps with ArcGIS Pro. This map is published in a paper in the Political Science Quarterly: [McKee et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1093/psquar/qqaf107).
