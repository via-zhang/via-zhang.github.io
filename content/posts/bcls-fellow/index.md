In my first year at the University of Florida (UF), I participated in the Path to Purpose Fellowship with UF's Brown Center for Leadership & Service. The fellowship is centered on local, impactful, collaborative action for social change. Throughout the year, I learned about conscious community engagement, ensuring that we co-create solutions with the community here in Gainesville, Florida. We embraced opportunities to be involved with vibrant and inspiring social change initiatives.

## The Power of Community
Throughout the fellowship, we learned about community collaboration and engagement, and how we can be involved in a meaningful way. I am passionate about supporting community-centered initiatives, and through Path to Purpose, I learned about the intricacies of community involvement and how we can be mindful, collaborative and impactful.

As a first-year student studying Geography and Data Science, I am passionate about how technology can support our work in climate action and environmental justice. I view technology and data as a bridge: helping us reach our goals and supporting us along the way.

The two main focus areas of my fellowship were:
- Data for social change, sustainability and civic engagement
- Geospatial data storytelling

## Civic Technology
Through the Path to Purpose Fellowship, I connected with the nonprofit organization, Florida Community Innovation (FCI). FCI's mission is to empower young people to create scalable technology that serve our communities across Florida. Since I started to work with FCI in the summer of 2023, I have collaborated on projects that apply technology and GIS for social impact. I helped research datasets for the Gentrification Risk Assessment Tool, which will be an educational GIS resource visualizing the impacts of gentrification in Gainesville.

Overall, I learned about the importance of civic tech: applying technology for public service. I learned about the value that technology can bring—when it is co-created and implemented in collaboration with communities to address local problems.

## Spatial Data Storytelling
As part of the fellowship, I delivered a lightning talk to our cohort about Spatial Data Storytelling for Environmental Justice.

I loved talking about the intersection of my passions: data, geography and environmental justice.

## Reflections
This past year has been an incredible journey of learning and growth. I loved having the opportunity to hear about inspiring social change work in Gainesville. One of the lessons I gained through Path to Purpose was that social change is intricate and intersectional: there are so many ways to be involved and contribute to collaborative solutions.
