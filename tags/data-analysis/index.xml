Miami has grown so much over the years, and we can visualize this through how the lights of Miami, captured by satellites at night, have become brighter. Miami has so much diversity and color everywhere you look, and I hope that this artwork can reflect that vibrant joy.

&lt;p>Shell mounds, or shell middens, are hills of accumulated shell (clams, oysters, and whelks), mud bricks, pottery shards, and other objects built up by generations of Indigenous peoples (Orengo et al., 2020; Florida Natural Areas Inventory, 2010). Shell mounds, found along the coastlines of the southeastern United States (Florida Natural Areas Inventory, 2010), give us a look at the past, helping us understand the lives of communities from hundreds to thousands of years ago. As such, they are a crucial part of our cultural landscapeâ€”imprinted evidence of history and heritage on the natural landscape (Taylor &amp;amp; Lennon, 2011).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
